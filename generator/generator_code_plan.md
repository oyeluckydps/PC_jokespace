## Data Models (`generator/generator_models.py`)

**Note: All prompts in this document are TEMPLATES. Actual prompts should be highly descriptive and include ALL points mentioned in corresponding code plan sections.**

**Core Models Required:**
- `TopicSet` - Python set containing one or more cleaned topics (from random selection or user comma-separated input)
- `HookTemplateContext` - Single hook-template pair with detailed generator explanation (always created together)
- `HigherOrderGroup` - Collection of 2+ hook-template-context combinations with group explanation
- `GenerationContext` - Unified context object (either first-order or higher-order) for joke generation
- `GeneratedJoke` - Individual joke with simple integer ID
- `JokePortfolio` - Complete collection of all generated jokes
- `FormattedJokeOutput` - Final XML structure matching exact sample_jokes.xml format

## Detailed File Descriptions and Functions

### Stage 1: Topic Processing (`generator/topic_processor.py`)

**File Purpose:** 
This file handles all topic input processing, converting any input into a standardized Python set of topics. It performs minimal cleaning (special characters removal except spaces, hyphens, and commas) and handles the empty input case by switching to random topic selection. Contains minimum working code focused on core functionality.

**Functions Required:**

**`get_random_topic() -> set`**
- Parses random_topics.xml file from generator folder using existing XML parser utilities
- Randomly selects exactly one topic from available topics
- Applies basic cleaning (removes special characters except spaces, hyphens)
- Returns Python set containing single cleaned topic string
- Uses fallback topic if XML parsing fails

**`process_user_input(user_input: str) -> set`**
- If user_input is empty string, calls get_random_topic() and returns result
- Splits input by commas and processes each topic individually
- Removes special characters except spaces, hyphens, and commas from each topic
- Strips whitespace and filters out empty strings
- Returns Python set of cleaned topic strings
- Minimal error handling - focuses on working code that achieves the task

**What This File Should Achieve:**
- Convert any input into standardized Python set of topics for downstream processing
- Handle empty input by automatically switching to random topic selection
- Perform essential cleaning while maintaining readability and usability
- Contain minimum working code focused on core functionality without over-engineering

### Stage 2: Hook-Template Generation (`generator/hook_template_generator.py`)

This file generates hook-template pairs along with their detailed explanatory contexts in a single LLM call using DSPy framework. Each hook-template pair is immediately accompanied by comprehensive explanation. Minimal code focused on effective LLM interaction and data structure creation.

**Functions Required:**

**`generate_hook_template_contexts(topic_set: set) -> list[HookTemplateContext]`**
- Converts topic set into formatted string for LLM consumption
- Makes single LLM call using DSPy framework to generate 15-20 hook-template pairs with contexts
- Uses DSPy signatures to ensure structured output without manual parsing
- Returns list of HookTemplateContext objects ready for downstream processing
- Essential error handling only

**Critical Prompt Template for Hook-Template-Context Generation:**
```
"Given the topic(s): {formatted_topic_set}

Generate 15-20 hook-template pairs with detailed explanations. Each item should contain:

1. HOOK POINT: A comedic anchor related to the topic(s) - can be:
   - Wordplay elements (puns, rhymes, sound-alikes)
   - Conceptual connections (related ideas, contrasts, associations)
   - Cultural references (known phrases, stereotypes, common knowledge)
   - Semantic relationships (synonyms, antonyms, categories)

2. JOKE TEMPLATE: A joke structure that works with this hook:
   - Classic formats ("Why did the X...", "What do you call...", "X walks into a bar...")
   - Setup-punchline structures
   - Comparison formats ("X is like Y because...")
   - Question-answer formats
   - Narrative formats with comedic reveals

3. GENERATOR EXPLANATION: Detailed strategy for using this combination:
   - How the hook connects comedically to the topic(s)
   - Why this template enhances the humor potential
   - Specific comedic techniques this combination enables
   - Multiple ways this pair can generate different jokes
   - What makes this combination particularly effective
   - How the hook and template complement each other

REQUIREMENTS:
- Maximize diversity in hook types and template structures
- Ensure each combination offers unique comedic approach
- Focus on combinations with clear, multiple joke generation paths
- Prioritize hooks with strong semantic/phonetic connections to topics
- Select templates that amplify the hook's comedic potential

[DSPy structured output format ensuring no manual parsing needed]"
```

**What This File Should Achieve:**
- Generate diverse hook-template combinations offering different comedic angles
- Provide comprehensive explanations serving as detailed guides for joke generation
- Ensure variety in hook types and template structures
- Create rich context enabling both simple and sophisticated joke generation
- Contain minimum working code focused on effective LLM interaction

### Stage 3: Higher-Order Group Creation (`generator/higher_order_grouper.py`)

**File Purpose:**
This file creates sophisticated combinations of multiple hook-template-context items that work together synergistically. LLM decides how many groups to create based on comedic potential. Each group comes with comprehensive explanation of multi-layered comedic strategies. Minimal code focused on LLM interaction and group formation.

**Functions Required:**

**`create_higher_order_groups(topic_set: set, hook_template_contexts: list) -> list[HigherOrderGroup]`**
- Takes topic set and all generated hook-template contexts as input

- Returns list of HigherOrderGroup objects with embedded contexts and explanations

**Critical Prompt Template for Higher-Order Group Creation:**
```
"Given the topic(s): {formatted_topic_set}

And these hook-template-context combinations:
{all_hook_template_contexts}

Create higher-order groups by combining multiple hook-template pairs that can work together synergistically to create sophisticated, multi-layered jokes.

GROUP CREATION CRITERIA:
- Combine 2-4 hook-template pairs that complement each other comedically
- Look for combinations that enable layered humor, complex wordplay, or conceptual connections
- Identify pairs that can be woven together in single jokes or joke sequences
- Focus on combinations that create MORE humor potential together than separately
- Only create groups where the combination genuinely enhances comedic possibilities

For each group, provide:
1. SELECTED HOOK-TEMPLATE PAIRS: The specific combinations you're grouping
2. GROUP GENERATOR EXPLANATION: Comprehensive strategy covering:
   - How these hooks can be connected, contrasted, or sequenced to create very funny jokes
   - How the templates can be combined, modified, or linked
   - What sophisticated humor strategies become possible with this group
   - Specific approaches for creating complex, layered jokes using this group

Treat each group of selected hook-templates as a single element for joke generation purposes.

CREATE AS MANY OR AS FEW GROUPS AS MAKE SENSE:
- If you see many synergistic opportunities, create more groups
- If few combinations offer genuine enhancement, create fewer groups
- Prioritize quality of synergy over quantity of groups
- Only group elements that truly work better together

[DSPy structured output format ensuring no manual parsing needed]"

## Key Design Principles

### Minimal Working Code
- Every file and function contains minimum code necessary to achieve its task
- Focus on core functionality without over-engineering or excessive error handling
- Essential error handling only where truly required
- No extreme edge case handling or over-generalization

### Simplified Data Flow
- Topics → Hook-Template-Contexts → Higher-Order Groups → Jokes → XML → Judge Results
- Each stage feeds cleanly into next with minimal transformation
- DSPy framework eliminates complex output parsing requirements
- Pipeline continues with partial results when possible

### Organized Logging and Output
- Timestamped log directories in logs/ folder using generator_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS format
- Separate output/ directory for final joke XML files
- Both directories created automatically if they don't exist
- Clear separation between debugging logs and final outputs

### Maximum LLM Creative Freedom
- All prompts explicitly grant permission to ignore, modify, or replace provided elements
- Emphasis on novel, original joke creation over element compliance
- Provided elements serve as inspiration and starting points, not requirements
- Quality and humor prioritized with mandatory topic connection

### Flexible Topic Handling
- Unified processing for single random topics and multiple user topics
- Basic cleaning removes special characters except spaces, hyphens, and commas
- Empty input automatically switches to random topic selection
- Topic set structure allows natural handling of both scenarios

### Seamless Integration
- Perfect compatibility with existing judge system through XML format matching
- CLI integration working with PC_jokespace structure via `python -m generator.cli`
- Reuse of existing utilities and infrastructure where possible
- Pipeline delivering final ranked results without manual intervention

**Important Note:** All prompt templates provided in this document are examples and starting points. Actual prompts should be significantly more detailed and include ALL the specific requirements, instructions, and points mentioned in each corresponding section of this code plan. The prompts should be comprehensive enough that an LLM can generate high-quality, appropriate responses meeting all specified criteria and objectives.
