# AI-Powered Joke Generation and Evaluation System

## Overview

This repository contains a sophisticated AI-powered system for **generating** and **evaluating** jokes using advanced Large Language Model (LLM) techniques. The system combines two powerful components:

1. **üé≠ Joke Generator** - A multi-stage pipeline that systematically creates high-quality jokes from topics
2. **‚öñÔ∏è Joke Judge** - A bias-mitigated evaluation system that rates and ranks jokes through comprehensive analysis

The system transforms simple topics into tournament-winning jokes through structured creativity, comprehensive evaluation, and competitive selection.

## System Architecture

### üéØ Core Philosophy

Rather than attempting direct joke generation, this system implements a **structured search approach** inspired by PLANSEARCH methodology. It searches over intermediate representations (hook-template pairs, categories, factors) to maximize creative diversity and output quality.

### üîÑ Complete Workflow

```
Topic Input ‚Üí Hook-Template Generation ‚Üí Higher-Order Grouping ‚Üí Joke Generation ‚Üí Comprehensive Rating ‚Üí Tournament Selection ‚Üí Winner Identification
```

## üé≠ Joke Generator Module

### Purpose
The generator transforms topics into diverse, high-quality jokes through a systematic 5-stage pipeline that prioritizes creativity while maintaining structure.

### Key Features
- **Hook-Template System**: Creates comedic anchors paired with compatible joke structures
- **Cross-Category Synthesis**: Combines different humor approaches for sophisticated jokes
- **Async Parallel Processing**: Generates jokes efficiently using configurable batch processing
- **Comprehensive Context Creation**: Builds rich explanatory frameworks for joke generation

### Generation Pipeline Stages
1. **Topic Processing**: Handles user input or random topic selection
2. **Hook-Template Generation**: Creates 15-20 diverse comedic foundations
3. **Higher-Order Grouping**: Forms synergistic combinations of hook-template pairs
4. **Joke Generation**: Produces ~40-100 jokes using parallel processing
5. **Output Formatting**: Creates XML compatible with the judge system

## ‚öñÔ∏è Joke Judge Module

### Purpose
The judge provides bias-mitigated, comprehensive evaluation of jokes through a sophisticated two-phase system designed for objectivity and precision.

### Key Features
- **Dual-Judge Architecture**: Combines broad classification with fine-tuned comparison
- **Bias Mitigation**: Position randomization, confidence scoring, and consistency checking
- **Tournament System**: Lives-based elimination with bye handling for fair competition
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed XML outputs for analysis and transparency

### Evaluation Pipeline
1. **Rating Judge**: Multi-dimensional scoring based on categories and factors
2. **Duel Judge**: Pairwise comparisons with bias mitigation techniques
3. **Tournament Manager**: Competitive elimination with lives system
4. **Result Analysis**: Winner identification with comprehensive ranking

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Quick Start Commands

#### Generate Jokes Only
```bash
# Generate jokes about a random topic
python cli.py

# Generate jokes about specific topics
python cli.py --topic "artificial intelligence, robots, future"

# Quick generation (skip higher-order grouping)
python cli.py --topic "coffee" --first-order-only --generation-only
```

#### Full Pipeline (Generation + Evaluation)
```bash
# Complete pipeline with default settings
python cli.py --topic "technology"

# Custom configuration for optimal results
python cli.py --topic "cooking, restaurants" --batch-size 6 --retries 4
```

#### Evaluate Existing Jokes
```bash
# Evaluate jokes from XML file
python -m judges temp/sample_jokes.xml

# Custom evaluation parameters
python -m judges jokes.xml --batch-size 30 --top-count 16

# Rating-only mode (skip tournament)
python -m judges jokes.xml --rating-only --top-count 10
```
