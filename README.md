# AI-Powered Joke Generation and Evaluation System

## Overview

This repository contains a sophisticated AI-powered system for **generating** and **evaluating** jokes using advanced Large Language Model (LLM) techniques. The system combines two powerful components:

1. **üé≠ Joke Generator** - A multi-stage pipeline that systematically creates high-quality jokes from topics
2. **‚öñÔ∏è Joke Judge** - A bias-mitigated evaluation system that rates and ranks jokes through comprehensive analysis

The system transforms simple topics into tournament-winning jokes through structured creativity, comprehensive evaluation, and competitive selection.

## System Architecture

### üéØ Core Philosophy

Rather than attempting direct joke generation, this system implements a **structured search approach** inspired by PLANSEARCH methodology. It searches over intermediate representations (hook-template pairs, categories, factors) to maximize creative diversity and output quality.

### üîÑ Complete Workflow

```
Topic Input ‚Üí Hook-Template Generation ‚Üí Higher-Order Grouping ‚Üí Joke Generation ‚Üí Comprehensive Rating ‚Üí Tournament Selection ‚Üí Winner Identification
```

## üé≠ Joke Generator Module

### Purpose
The generator transforms topics into diverse, high-quality jokes through a systematic 5-stage pipeline that prioritizes creativity while maintaining structure.

### Key Features
- **Hook-Template System**: Creates comedic anchors paired with compatible joke structures
- **Cross-Category Synthesis**: Combines different humor approaches for sophisticated jokes
- **Async Parallel Processing**: Generates jokes efficiently using configurable batch processing
- **Comprehensive Context Creation**: Builds rich explanatory frameworks for joke generation
- **Scalable Jokespace**: Configurable output volume from quick prototyping to comprehensive generation

### Generation Pipeline Stages
1. **Topic Processing**: Handles user input or random topic selection
2. **Hook-Template Generation**: Creates 5-15+ diverse comedic foundations (based on jokespace size)
3. **Higher-Order Grouping**: Forms 1-8+ synergistic combinations of hook-template pairs
4. **Joke Generation**: Produces 10-100+ jokes using parallel processing
5. **Output Formatting**: Creates XML compatible with the judge system

### Jokespace Configuration

The system supports three jokespace sizes to match different use cases:

| Jokespace | Hook-Templates | Higher-Order Groups | Expected Jokes | Use Case |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Small** | 1-5 | 1-3 | 10-15 | Quick testing, rapid prototyping |
| **Medium** | 5-10 | 3-8 | 25-50 | Balanced generation, most applications |
| **Large** | 10+ | 8+ | 50+ | Comprehensive datasets, research |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Joke Judge Module

### Purpose
The judge provides bias-mitigated, comprehensive evaluation of jokes through a sophisticated two-phase system designed for objectivity and precision.

### Key Features
- **Dual-Judge Architecture**: Combines broad classification with fine-tuned comparison
- **Bias Mitigation**: Position randomization, confidence scoring, and consistency checking
- **Tournament System**: Lives-based elimination with bye handling for fair competition
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed XML outputs for analysis and transparency

### Evaluation Pipeline
1. **Rating Judge**: Multi-dimensional scoring based on categories and factors
2. **Duel Judge**: Pairwise comparisons with bias mitigation techniques
3. **Tournament Manager**: Competitive elimination with lives system
4. **Result Analysis**: Winner identification with comprehensive ranking

- **Output**: 10-15 jokes
- **Use when**: Testing new topics, debugging, proof-of-concept work

**Medium Jokespace** (`--jokespace medium`) *[Default]*
- **Best for**: Most production use cases, balanced quality/quantity
- **Performance**: ~2-4 minutes execution time  
- **Output**: 25-50 diverse jokes
- **Use when**: Content creation, standard workflows, balanced analysis
