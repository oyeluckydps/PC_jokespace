# AI-Powered Joke Generation and Evaluation System

## Overview

This repository contains a sophisticated AI-powered system for **generating** and **evaluating** jokes using advanced Large Language Model (LLM) techniques. The system combines two powerful components:

1. **üé≠ Joke Generator** - A multi-stage pipeline that systematically creates high-quality jokes from topics
2. **‚öñÔ∏è Joke Judge** - A bias-mitigated evaluation system that rates and ranks jokes through comprehensive analysis

The system transforms simple topics into tournament-winning jokes through structured creativity, comprehensive evaluation, and competitive selection.

## Setup

1. Clone the latest release from https://github.com/oyeluckydps/PC_jokespace/releases/tag/v1.1.2 or whichever release has the latest tag, as new features are continuously added!

2. Create a new virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies from the root directory (PC_jokespace):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Add your Anthropic API key to your environment. The system uses Haiku 3.0 model by default and may cost up to 20 cents for a complete run (approximately 5 jokes per dollar üòÜ). While OpenRouter free models are supported as fallback, they are not robust enough for optimal performance.

   **Primary option:**
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   **Alternative option:**
   Create `secret/LLAMA_API_KEY.txt` and put your OpenRouter API key for "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free" there.

5. Test the installation:
   ```bash
   python -m cli --topic "ant" --jokespace "small"
   ```
   ( Must launch it from project root i.e. .../PC_jokespace/ )

   This will launch a comprehensive pipeline with a joke generator that creates about 10-15 jokes and a joke judge that selects the best joke. After 1-2 minutes, you'll have a novel, witty, punny joke!

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

( Must launch these commands from project root i.e. .../PC_jokespace/ )

**Generate jokes with random topic:**
```bash
python -m cli
```

**Generate jokes for specific topic:**
```bash
python -m cli --topic "pizza"
```

**Generate multiple jokes:**
```bash
python -m cli --topic "cat" --count 5
```

### CLI Arguments

The generator CLI supports the following arguments:

- `--topic TOPIC`: Topic for joke generation (default: random selection)
- `--jokespace {small,medium,large}`: Generation scale (default: medium)
  - **small**: 10-15 jokes, ~60-120 seconds, ideal for testing
  - **medium**: 25-50 jokes, ~2-4 minutes, balanced for most use cases
  - **large**: 50+ jokes, ~5-10 minutes, comprehensive generation
- `--count COUNT`: Number of final jokes to select (default: 1)
- `--output-dir DIR`: Output directory for logs and results
- `--retries NUM`: Maximum retry attempts for API calls
- `--bypass-cache`: Force fresh generation without cache

### Sample Workflows

( Must launch these commands from project root i.e. .../PC_jokespace/ )

**Quick Testing:**
```bash
python -m cli --topic "coffee" --jokespace small
```

**A reletavily funny joke:**
```bash
python -m cli --topic "technology" --jokespace medium --count 3
```

**A really FUNNY joke (by searching over a large jokespace):**
```bash
python -m cli --topic "space exploration" --jokespace large --bypass-cache
```

**Custom Output:**
```bash
python -m cli --topic "music" --count 5 --output-dir ./music_jokes
```

## Judge System

For evaluating existing joke collections, use the judge module directly:

( Must launch these commands from project root i.e. .../PC_jokespace/ )

```bash
python -m judges.cli path/to/jokes.xml
```

The judge system provides sophisticated bias-mitigated evaluation through rating and tournament phases. For detailed judge CLI options and usage, see [`./judges/README.md`](./judges/README.md).

## System Architecture

### üéØ Core Philosophy

Rather than attempting direct joke generation, this system implements a **structured search approach** inspired by PLANSEARCH methodology. It searches over intermediate representations (categories, factors, hook points) to maximize creative diversity and output quality.

```

## Performance Considerations

The jokespace size affects multiple aspects of generation:

- **LLM API Costs**: Large jokespace requires more API calls
- **Execution Time**: Scales roughly linearly with jokespace size
- **Memory Usage**: Higher-order synthesis increases with larger jokespaces
- **Tournament Competition**: More jokes create more competitive tournaments

Choose your jokespace based on your needs:
- Use **small** for quick testing and concept validation
- Use **medium** for most production use cases
- Use **large** for research and comprehensive analysis

## API Costs

The system uses Claude Haiku 3.0 model for API calls. A complete run typically costs around 20 cents, yielding approximately 5 jokes per dollar. Monitor your API usage when processing large datasets or running extensive evaluations, especially with large jokespace configurations.
